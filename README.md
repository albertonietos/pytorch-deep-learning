# pytorch-deep-learning
This repository contains different deep learning use cases developed in Pytorch. This work builds upon the work performed during the 
Deep Learning course at Aalto University.

# Description
The notebooks contain the implementation in PyTorch of different deep learning methods applied to a variety of tasks based on the original papers they were published on.
The models include in this repo are:

* [Multilayer perceptrons](https://github.com/albertonietos/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/master/multilayer-perceptron)
* [Convolutional neural networks](https://github.com/albertonietos/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/master/convolutional-neural-network) (LeNet, VGG, ResNet)
* [Transformers](https://github.com/albertonietos/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/master/transformer)
* [Graph neural networks](https://github.com/albertonietos/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/master/graph-neural-network)
* [Autoencoders](https://github.com/albertonietos/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/master/autoencoder) (Vanilla AE, DAE, VAE)
* [Autoregressive models](https://github.com/albertonietos/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/master/autoregressive-model) (PixelCNN)
* [Generative adversarial networks](https://github.com/albertonietos/pytorch-deep-learning/tree/master/generative-adversarial-network) (DCGAN, WGAN-GP)
